Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.It plays an important role in the tech industry by allowing the creation of software applications and systems that speerhead various apects of our today lives including healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The invention of programming languages like Fortran and C which enabled humans to solve problems technologically using the then emmerged digital computers.
-The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s and rise of agile metholodies in the early 21st century.
-Influential figures including pioneers such as Alan Turinf=g and others who made a huge difference in the field through their research, inventions and writings.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements ; gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
-Design ; creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-Implementation ; writing code and building the software according to the design's specifications.
-Testing ; conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the required standards.
-Deployment ; releasing the software to users.
-Maintenance ; providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards for example Design while Agile methodology is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexiblity,collaboration and responding to change for example Lean.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
(a)Software Developer - He is resposible for writing code and implemeting software solutions.
(b)Quality Assurance Engineer - He ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
(c)Project Manager - He oversees the planning,execution and delivery of Software Applications.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
(a)Integrated Development Environments(IDEs)-It provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code for example Visual Studio Code,Eclipse.
(b)Version Control Systems(VCS)-Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git,Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges;
          (a) Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
           (b) Technical Debts- Accrued from shortcuts, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Solutions;
          Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication , agile methodologies,prioritization of tasks and regular re-assessment of project goals and timelines. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
(a)Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
(b)Integration Testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
(c)System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
(d)Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the crafting of clear,transparent and specific instructions to get the desired output from an AI model.Interacting with AI modes allows humans to automate repetitive tasks enabling them to achieve their full potential.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
(a)Vague Prompt;Generate an image of a bird.
(b)Clear and Specific Prompt;Generate a vibrant image of a white dove hanging on the edge of a tweak on a drizzling day.
-The second prompt is gives birth to less generic output because it gives the model specified instructions to guide its output further.
